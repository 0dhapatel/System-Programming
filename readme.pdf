The Huffmancode book is made by first tokensizing the file found. The process is similar when there is a R flag. 
In tokanizing we have used the strtok() function in the string.h header file. After that we have used a parallel array to copy 
the word from tokanizing to the string 2d pointer. When  a NULL space is found the word is inserted and the frequency becomes 
When the word is similar to another, the frquency increases instead and the word is kept the same. From there the hufffman 
codebook is made by calling on the huffman code. The tree is made using the data structure heaps and nodes. The heap is made 
by realizing how many unique words are preseant. After each comparison the node is either combined with another or combined 
with the tree based on the comparrison of the numbers in the heap. The samellest number is kept on the left side while the 
biggest is kept on the right side. Similarlly the left side is binary of 0's while right side is binary of 1's. First we made 
a leaf node for each remarkable character and amass a min heap of all leaf centers (Min Heap is used as a need line. The 
estimation of repeat field is used to consider two centers in min store. At first, the least ceaseless character is at root). 
Next we concentrate two center points with the base repeat from the min store. Then, we made another inside center point with 
repeat equal to the entire of the two centers frequencies. Make the primary evacuated center as its left child and the other
removed center as its right tyke. Add this center point to the min heap. The remainder of the center is the root center and 
the tree is done. Thats how our b flag and R and b flag were taken care of.
